Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements,MovingGameElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): GameElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements,Pacman,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: MOUTH_SIZE; END_MOUTH_ARC; CELL_SIZE_TO_PACMAN_SIZE_RATIO; CELL_SIZE_TO_EYE_SIZE_RATIO; CELL_SIZE_TO_PUPIL_SIZE_RATIO; PADDING; PACMAN_COLOR; EYE_COLOR; PUPIL_COLOR; timeBeforeClosingMouth; actualTimer; keyDirectionMap; newDirection
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,ATimeBasedElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AExtensionElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,FishElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ATimeBasedElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,GrenadeElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AExtensionElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,PepperElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ATimeBasedElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,PotatoElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ATimeBasedElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,Projectile,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): MovingGameElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,TeleporterElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AExtensionElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,TomatoElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ATimeBasedElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Elements.ExtensionElements,TrapElement,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): ATimeBasedElement
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Game,Cell,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Game,EventHandler,Unexploited Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Pacman; Ghost in method movingElementActionPerformed
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Game,EventHandler,Missing Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Pacman; Ghost in method movingElementActionPerformed
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Game,GameCollisionsMap,Rebellious Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell in this class because method(s) of this class reject the methods provided by its supertypes. The method(s) that reject the suptertype's method are: onCollision
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Game,GameWorld,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: CELL_SIZE; PELLET; SUPER_PELLET; BLINKY; PINKY; INKY; CLYDE; NOTHING; PACMAN; PACMAN_SPEED; GHOST_SPEED; TRAP; TELEPORTER; BRIDGE; GRENADE; PEPPER; TOMATO; RED_BEAN; POTATO; FISH; EXTENSION_ELEMENTS; oldTeleporter; ELEMENT_BUILDERS; CELL_BUILDERS; width; height; soundManager; view; eventHandler; cells; cellMap; gameSpeed; numberOfPelletsAtStart; portalBlue; portalOrange
pacman-system3,pacman_infd.Game,GameWorld,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 21 public methods
pacman-system3,pacman_infd,Pacman_INFD,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
