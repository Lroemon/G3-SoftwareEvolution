Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
pacman-system1,nl.tudelft.jpacman,Launcher,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: SPRITE_STORE; DEFAULT_MAP; levelMap; pacManUI; game
pacman-system1,nl.tudelft.jpacman.level,DefaultPlayerInteractionMap,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
pacman-system1,nl.tudelft.jpacman.level,PlayerCollisions,Unexploited Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed while those types belong to the same hierarchy. The participating types that were checked are: Player; Ghost; Pellet in method collide
pacman-system1,nl.tudelft.jpacman.level,PlayerCollisions,Missing Hierarchy,The tool detected the smell because a set of type checks are performed to explicitly manage variation in behavior where a hierarchy could have been formed consisting of these participating types. The participating types that were checked are: Player; Ghost; Pellet in method collide
pacman-system1,nl.tudelft.jpacman.ui,Action,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
pacman-system1,nl.tudelft.jpacman.ui,ScorePanel,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: serialVersionUID; scoreLabels; DEFAULT_SCORE_FORMATTER; scoreFormatter
pacman-system1,nl.tudelft.jpacman.e2e.framework.startup,StartupSteps,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
pacman-system1,nl.tudelft.jpacman.e2e.framework.startup,StartupTest,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class:
